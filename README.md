# HR-Attrition-Analysis

![](HR_Intro.jpg)

## Introduction

Welcome to our HR Attrition Analysis Project
This project aims to meticulously examine employee attrition patterns within the organization, providing valuable insights into the underlying factors contributing to turnover. By leveraging data analytics and predictive modeling, we intend to uncover actionable strategies to enhance employee retention and organizational stability. Join us in exploring the data-driven journey towards a more resilient and engaged workforce.

### Dataset

- Project Name: Employee Retention
- Dataset Name: HR_1 and HR_2
- Dataset Type: Excel Data
- Dataset Size: 50,000 records each

## Problem Statement

The key areas of analysis include:

- Average Attrition rate for all Departments.
- Average Hourly rate of Male Research Scientist.
- Attrition rate Vs Monthly income stats.
- Average working years for each Department.
- Job Role Vs Work life balance.
- Attrition rate Vs Year since last promotion relation.

## Skills/Concepts Demonstrated

This project demonstrates proficiency in:

- Data cleaning and preprocessing.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).
- Power BI (Bookmarking, DAX, Quick Measures, Modelling, Filters, Tooltips.)
- Statistical analysis to derive insights.
- MySQL (Joins, Group by, Having, Window Functions, View, Aggregate Functions.)
  
## Modelling

Built a Data Model using HR_1 and HR_2 as one to many relationship.
